# TODO: Additional Test Scenarios

## Error Handling Tests
- API errors (list, create, delete operations)
- File content loading errors
- Network failures
- Invalid responses

## Loading States Tests
- Initial file list loading
- File content loading
- File operations in progress
- Multiple concurrent operations

## Concurrent Operations Tests
- Multiple file creations
- Rapid folder operations
- Simultaneous file operations
- Race condition handling

Example test cases: 

```typescript
// Error handling examples
it("should handle API errors gracefully")
it("should handle file content loading errors")
it("should handle file creation errors")
// Loading state examples
it("should show loading state during initial file list fetch")
it("should show loading state during file content fetch")
// Concurrent operations examples
it("should handle multiple file creations")
it("should handle rapid folder operations")
```
