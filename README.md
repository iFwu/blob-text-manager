## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or later
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- A Vercel account and Blob Storage access

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/iFwu/vercel-blob-manager.git
cd vercel-blob-manager
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file with your Vercel Blob credentials:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="your_vercel_blob_token"
```

4. For testing with client-side implementation, create a `.env.test.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="your_vercel_blob_token"
NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_TEST="true"
```

### Development

Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
# or for testing environment
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

## Architecture

The application uses a hybrid approach for Blob Storage operations:
- Server-side implementation (`actions.server.ts`) for production
- Client-side implementation (`actions.client.ts`) for testing
- Environment-based switching between implementations
